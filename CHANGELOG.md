* Upgrades RubyDNS to 2.1.1.

## 2.4.2 (2025-06-27)

* Fix plugin hooking for multi-machine setups. [GH-78]

## 2.4.0 (2023-04-11)

* DHCP support. [GH-51]
* Non-A-queries (like IPv6 AAAA- or TXT records) matching a configured pattern will be answered with a `NOTIMP` error. [GH-76]
* Upstream / passthrough DNS servers are now configurable, defaulting to the system config (existing behavior). [GH-76]
* Passthrough behavior is now configurable (`true`/`false`/`:unknown`). [GH-77]

## 2.2.3

### Fixes:

* Workaround for a Vargant-on-Ventura issue, crashing the DNS process. [GH-72]

## 2.2.2

### Fixes:

* Installation issue due to updated sub-dependency. [GH-69]

## 2.2.1

### Fixes:

* Prevent action hooks (restarting dns server) from running multiple times [GH-67]

## 2.2.0

### New Features:

* Add global config for time-to-live via `VagrantDNS::Config.ttl`

### Fixes:

* Fixes acceptance tests for macOS High Sierra (10.13) to cope with `scutil`s new output format
* Adds the log-time missing `license` gem config

### Breaking Changes:

* Removes the global and vm config  `ipv4only`. It was never used.

### Changes:

* Resources will now respond with a low TTL (time-to-live) of 5 minutes (300 seconds) instead of the old 24 hours by default. Use `VagrantDNS::Config.ttl = 86400` to reset to the old behavior.
* Internal changes on how the dns pattern config is read and written. (Now using `YAML::Store`)
* Acceptance tests run against vagrant v2.1.4
* Acceptance tests run against Ubuntu 18.04

### New Features:

* Adds a check for the VMs configured TLDs to not be included in the [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/)

## 2.1.0

### Breaking, internal changes:

* The version moved from `Vagrant::DNS::VERSION` to `VagrantDNS::VERSION`, removing an accidental highjack of the `Vagrant` namespace.
* The `VagrantDNS::RestartMiddleware` got split up into `VagrantDNS::Middlewares::ConfigUp`, `VagrantDNS::Middlewares::ConfigDown` and `VagrantDNS::Middlewares::Restart`

### Fixes:

* Fixes cli short argument `-S` for `--stop` (collided with `--start`'s `-s`)

### New Feautres:

* Adds new cli command `--status` to display process running status and PID
* Adds new cli command `--list` to display current (persisted) config
* Adds auto-cleanup: Removes registered dns pattern from config when destroying the box. It will, however, be re-created when some box in the project gets re/started or one of vagrant dns `--install`, `--start` or `--restart` is executed.

### Changes:

* The cli command `--stop` no longer re-builds configuration.
